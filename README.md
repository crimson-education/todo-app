# Todo App

## Overview

The goal of this technical screen test is to implement a simple todo list app. At the end of the screen, users should be able to create, delete, and manage todo items.

You can see an example app here: https://todomvc.com/examples/elm/

There's no need to make the app pretty; you just need to implement the functionality described below. Feel free to use any library you'd like to.

You can get started by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ npm ci
$ npm run dev
```

The app should then be available at http://localhost:3000/

## Challenges

1. Implement adding a todo.
2. Implement displaying todos.
3. Allow the user to delete a todo from their list.
4. Allow the user to mark a todo as done. Todos which are done should be crossed out.
5. Allow the user to filter the visible todos. They should be able to filter by "all", "done", or "not done".
